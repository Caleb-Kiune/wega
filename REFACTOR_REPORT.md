## 🔵 Files/Folders Successfully Moved/Renamed

### Test Files Moved
All test files successfully moved from root and backend root to `backend/tests/`:
```
✅ test_backend.py → backend/tests/test_backend.py
✅ test_delivery_locations.py → backend/tests/test_delivery_locations.py
✅ test_brands_categories.py → backend/tests/test_brands_categories.py
✅ test_track_order.py → backend/tests/test_track_order.py
✅ test_filters.py → backend/tests/test_filters.py
✅ backend/test_*.py → backend/tests/
```

### Scripts Organized
All one-time fix scripts successfully moved to `backend/scripts/`:
```
✅ backend/fix_*.py → backend/scripts/
✅ backend/comprehensive_url_fix.py → backend/scripts/
✅ backend/check_remaining_urls.py → backend/scripts/
✅ backend/simple_fix.py → backend/scripts/
```

### Frontend Structure Consolidation
**Issue**: Components scattered between `app/components/` and `frontend/src/components/`

**Completed Actions**: 
1. ✅ Decided on single location (`app/components/`)
2. ✅ Moved all components from `frontend/src/components/` to `app/components/`
3. ✅ Updated all imports to use consistent paths
4. ✅ Removed `frontend/src/components/` directory
5. ✅ Removed `frontend/src/shared/` directory

---

## ⚙️ Import/Export Updates Successfully Completed

### TypeScript Path Mapping
Successfully updated `tsconfig.json`:
```json
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./app/*"],
  "@components/*": ["./app/components/*"],
  "@lib/*": ["./app/lib/*"],
  "@shared/*": ["./app/shared/*"],
  "@contexts/*": ["./app/contexts/*"]
}
```

### Import Statement Updates
Successfully updated all import statements to use consistent paths:
- ✅ Replaced `@/components/` with `@components/`
- ✅ Replaced `@/lib/` with `@lib/`
- ✅ Ensured all imports use the consolidated component locations
