# Search Ratings Hidden - Summary

## üéØ Changes Made

Successfully hidden product ratings from search suggestions and search results to provide a cleaner, more focused search experience.

## üìã Files Modified

### 1. `app/components/header.tsx`
**Location**: Header search results display (lines ~707-715)
**Change**: Removed the rating display section that showed:
- Star icon
- Rating value (e.g., "4.5")
- Review count (e.g., "(12)")

**Before:**
```tsx
{product.rating && product.rating > 0 && (
  <div className="flex items-center text-yellow-400">
    <Star className="h-4 w-4 fill-current" />
    <span className="text-xs text-gray-500 ml-1">
      {product.rating.toFixed(1)}
      {product.review_count && (
        <span className="text-gray-400"> ({product.review_count})</span>
      )}
    </span>
  </div>
)}
```

**After:**
```tsx
{/* Ratings hidden - removed for cleaner search results */}
```

### 2. `app/components/search-modal.tsx`
**Location**: Search modal results display (lines ~456-462)
**Change**: Removed the rating display section that showed:
- Star icon
- Rating value

**Before:**
```tsx
{product.rating && (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
    <Star className="h-3 w-3 fill-yellow-400 text-yellow-400" />
    <span className="text-xs text-gray-500">{product.rating}</span>
  </div>
)}
```

**After:**
```tsx
{/* Ratings hidden - removed for cleaner search results */}
```

## üé® Visual Impact

- More focused on essential product information
- Streamlined user experience

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Cleaner Interface**: Search results are less cluttered and easier to scan
2. **Faster Scanning**: Users can quickly identify products without rating distractions
3. **Consistent Experience**: Both header and modal search now have the same clean appearance
4. **Focused Information**: Emphasizes product name, price, and category - the most important details for search

## üîç What's Still Visible

The search results still display:
- ‚úÖ **Product Name** (with search term highlighting)
- ‚úÖ **Product Price** (formatted as KES)
- ‚úÖ **Product Category** (with search term highlighting)
- ‚úÖ **Product Image** (thumbnail)
